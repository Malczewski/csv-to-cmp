Darth Vader,"This is Darth Vader. I require immediate assistance with the Death Star.",
Zara,"This is Zara from Galactic ow may I assist you, Lord Vader?",2
Darth Vader,"The Death Star's primary weapon malfunctioned during a crucial operation. I suspect it's due to a design flaw in the exhaust vent system.",
Zara,"I see, that sounds like a serious issue. Let's try to troubleshoot it. Have you attempted to recalibrate the targeting system?",
Darth Vader,"Yes, I've recalibrated it multiple times, but the problem persists. We need a more permanent solution.",
K-3PO,"Greetings, Lord Vader. This is K-3PO, your loyal droid Perhaps the vent shaft needs to be cleared of any debris or obstructions?",
Darth Vader,"That's a possibility. How do we proceed with that?",
Zara,"Understood, Lord Vader. I'll relay the order to the maintenance crew right away.",1
Darth Vader,"Excellent. We cannot afford any further delays.",
K-3PO,"While we wait for the maintenance droids to arrive, have you considered reinforcing the vent shaft with additional durasteel plating?", 2
Darth Vader,"A temporary solution, but it might buy us some time. Proceed with the reinforcement.",
Zara,"I'm coordinating with the engineering team to implement the durasteel plating as we speak.",
Darth Vader,"Good. Let's hope this prevents any future mishaps.",
K-3PO,"The reinforcement process is underway, Lord Vader. We should see improvements in the system's stability soon.",-1
K-3PO,"Understood, my lord. I shall oversee the installation process personally.",1
Darth Vader,"See to it that everything is executed flawlessly. I will not tolerate any more failures.",
Zara,"The maintenance droids have cleared the vent shaft, and the durasteel plating has been successfully installed, Lord Vader.",
Darth Vader,"Excellent. Let us hope these measures prove sufficient to prevent any future incidents.",
K-3PO,"The additional thermal exhaust ports have also been installed, Lord Vader. The Death Star's defenses are now significantly strengthened.",
Darth Vader,"Very good. Your efficiency is commendable, K-3PO. That will be all for now.",2
Zara,"Is there anything else you require, Lord Vader?",
Darth Vader,"No, you may return to your duties. May the Force be with you.",
